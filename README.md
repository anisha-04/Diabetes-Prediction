# Diabetes-Prediction

In this project, we will be exploring a dataset that provides information on diabetes basaed on certain diagnostic measurements and build a model to predict whether the person is diabetic or non-diabetic through Support Vector Machine.

The dataset is collected from "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kideny Diseases". The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic measurements. The data records all about the females that are or at least above the age of 21 years of 'Pima Indian Heritage'.
